# Install

## Download

Open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper/releases/latest), you can find 2 files with `.dmg` suffix. One with `nojava` tag, another without. If you are not familiar with Java, please choose the one **without** nojava tag.

Open the `.dmg` file, and then run the installer, follow the wizard to install.

### Auto-start

If you check the box to start with the system, PBH will silently start to the system tray when you log in to the macOS desktop.

## GUI/GUI Silent/NoGUI

### GUI

Launch PeerBanHelper with a graphical window. There will be a window to view logs, and a menu to open the data folder and log in to the WebUI without logging in.

Close the window by clicking the close button, it will minimize to the system tray icon.

### GUI Silent

Similar to GUI, but just the system tray, no window.

### NoGUI

Start in console mode, the most resource-saving.
