# Installer

:::tip
It does not meet the [FSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) standard, [Docker](../Docker.md) is recommended for Linux users.
:::

For Redhat-based users, please go to [Releases](https://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper/releases) to download a `.rpm` package, for other users please download the `.sh` file.

The installer will use CLI by default, if your Linux installation supports a desktop environment, the graphical installer will be started, just like the Windows version.
