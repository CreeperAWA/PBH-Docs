# Manual Install

:::tip
[Docker](../Docker.md) is more recommended.
:::

## Install OpenJDK

Use your package manager to install OpenJDK 21 or higher (here is an example using apt):

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-21-jdk-headless -y
```

Verify the installation:

```shell
java -version
```

If the installation is successful, you will see output similar to the following:

```plain
openjdk version "xx.xx.xxx" 2024-01-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build xxxxxxx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build xxxxxxx, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Download Jar

Download the `jar` and `libraries.tar.gz` from [Release](https://github.com/PBH-BTN/PeerBanHelper/releases/latest).

Unzip them into a same directory.

Using following command to launch PBHï¼š

```shell
java -Xmx512M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+ShrinkHeapInSteps -jar <jar file>
```

PBH will automatically detect the desktop environment and enable the GUI if supported, but the GUI may fail to initialize on some devices. In such cases, manually disable the GUI:

```shell
java -Xmx512M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+ShrinkHeapInSteps -jar <jar file> nogui
```
